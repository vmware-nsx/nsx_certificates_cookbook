# nsx_certificates_cookbook
This repository includes all the scripts part of the NSX Certificates Management cookbook published on [VMware communities](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-NSX-Documents/NSX-Certifcates-Management-Cookbook/ta-p/2992832)
The script has been added to this repository as the copy and paste from the PDF document produces formatting errors.

The only requirements to run the scripts are bash and [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/). You can install jq via the usual package manager of your system (i.e., homebrew or apt)
